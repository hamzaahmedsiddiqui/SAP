## Future Work

Thank you for the test because it gave me a starting point to learn. I am currently tied up with my thesis thats why I couldn't give it as much time as I wanted to. During this test, I got to know about unit testing and code architecture. I used MVVM for coded arcchitecture and deligate Pattern to make coded clean. I haven't added more test cases because of time but added some test case to showcase my concepts of Unit Testing. Moreover the third party libraries I used are Alamofire as it take care of network request in a better way, we can also use URLSession to call Api as we are just calling single api in this application. I used swiftyJson because SwiftyJSON makes it easy to deal with JSON data in Swift, I used Kingfisher because it is a powerful, pure-Swift library for downloading and caching images from the web. For saving search history I used NSUserDefault because we have to save small data, For large data I would prefer coredata or SQLit or Realm.


Thanks.
